This is the final exam for the 'Pythin is Easy Class'

I chose to work with the Freecell card game due to the love that I have
for it. I also believe that it'll be a good challenge for me

Basically, the Freecell is a single player game and it doesn't depend on luck. 
Winning depends on the player's strategy, tactics, and the dealt deck.

It uses the following rules:
    1. The goal is to move all cards to the foundation pile/home.
       The cards must be arranged in their suits from A, 2...10, J, Q, K
    2. The freecells can hold any one card at a time
    3. The cards can be arranged in the columns in alternating colors
       from K, Q, J, 10, ... 2, A. That is, a black card can
       only be placed on a red one in descending order, and vice versa
    4. A column remains empty when the last card is removed from it
    5. Any card can be moved to an empty column
    6. The number of cards that can be moved to a different column 
       depends on the number of freecells and empty columns.
       You cannot move more cards than the availability of 
       space to hold the cards being moved.(Freecells or empty columns)
