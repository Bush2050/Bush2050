# About me
I am an Instrumentation and Control Engineer based in Kenya. I recently gained interest in programming and am in the process of learning to code. I decided to join this network to make my learning process smooth and collaborative. As at now (the time when I'm writing this), I know two languages quite well. I have previously been working on _**python**_ and am in the process of reminding myself _the **java** language_.
Below are some of the projects that I have been and I'm still working on (sic). I will categorize them according to the language to make it easy to browse through them.
**Please dive right in and thanks for visiting.**

# Projects
## Python
The first 4 projects below, namely, the connect 4, Hangman, TicTacToe, and FreeCell were part of my class work. I took the course named [_Python is Easy_](https://www.pirple.com/courses/take/python-is-easy/). 
While I gave much customization to the projects, I believe there may still be better ways of handling them, and I will always welcome suggestions on how to improve them.

**1. TicTacToe**
TicTacToe is a famous game and especially among those lerning to code. It is basically a 2 player 3 X 3 grid game where each player aims to place their pieces to form a straight line. One player uses 'X' and the other uses 'O'. 
In my version of TicTacToe, I have provided provisions for both single and 2-player modes. In single player mode, the player plays agains the computer, which will try to prevent the player from winning and it will also attempt to win before the player.
Furthermore, to make it more fun, I provided 3 hard mode levels for the single player. Please check it out.

**2. Connect 4**
This project shows a Command Line Interface (CLI) version of the Connect 4 game. Instead of black and red icons representing the different players' pieces, I decided to use the letters 'X' and 'O' just as in TicTacToe. Just like in the TicTacToe described above, I have provided both 2-player and single-player modes.
When playing the single-player mode, the computer will try winning before the player while actively preventing the player from winning.
Please try it out and provide reviews and suggestions for improvement. Thanks

**3. Hangman**
The Hangman is also a common game for new programmers. It is basically a guessing game whereby the player tries guessing a workd one letter at a time.
The catch is that the player has a definite number of wrong guesses that they can make. With each wrong letter, a line-man moves a step closer to getting hanged.
If however, the player guesses the name with less wrong guesses, they win the game. 
My game also provides a single and 2 player modes and in the single player mode, the game offers differnt hard levels from which the player can choose.
Please check it out and give me feedback. Thank you.

**4. FreeCell**
This was my final project for the course [Python is Easy](https://www.pirple.com/courses/take/python-is-easy/). While it was not necessary to make it as realistic as it is now, I decided to continue working on it. I could say that it is currently my most advanced piece of code ever.
I have made the FreeCell game to look as realistic as possible despite being a CLI game. 
It follows all the rules of the freecell game with a slight improvement, namely, it also shows how far the player has gone in completing the game as a percentage.


**5. Sudoku Solver**
According to my plan, this is supposed to be my best program ever. Once complete, it will be able to solve any sudoku puzzle passed to it. 
Currently it is still _a work in progress..._

## Java
I am currently refreshing myself in java from [Fundamentals of Java](https://www.pirple.com/courses/take/fundamentals-of-java/). I will keep updating projects that I do in this language. Currently I do not yet have a worthy program to paste here. Your patience is highly appreciated.
